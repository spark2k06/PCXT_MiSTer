# PCXT SoCkit

Port to SoCkit by Somhic from original MiSTer port currently in development  https://github.com/spark2k06/PCXT_MiSTer

Now can be loaded SO through serial at GPIO addon. See pinout at sys.tcl.  Only needs Rx/Tx signals.

```
serdrive.exe -c <port> -d 115.2KB <image>
```

# PCXT_MiSTer

PCXT port for MiSTer by spark2k06.

The purpose of this core is to implement a PCXT as reliable as possible. For this purpose, the MCL86 core from @MicroCoreLabs and KTPC-XT from @kitune-san are used.

The Graphics Gremlin project from TubeTimeUS (@schlae) has also been integrated in this first stage.

SN76489AN Compatible Implementation in VHDL Copyright (c) 2005, 2006, Arnim Laeuger (arnim.laeuger@gmx.net)

Place boot.rom (in SW folder) inside games/PCXT folder at root of SD card.

### Demo

# TODO

* Refactor Graphics Gremlin module, the new KFPC-XT system will make this refactor possible.
* IDE module implementation
* Floppy implementation
* VHD support for easy integration with [XTIDE Universal BIOS](https://www.xtideuniversalbios.org/)
* Addition of other modules:
    * EMS    
    * Others...

* Turbo mode (7.16Mhz)

# Mounting the disk image

Beta 1.0 opens a new beta phase in which any user can participate and give feedback. Just copy the script "pcxt_uart_hdd.sh" to the scripts folder and "serdrive" to the core working folder, i.e. "./games/PCXT", these files are located in the SW folder of this project. Also, place in this same folder (./games/PCXT) a bootable image with the corresponding OS and under the name "hdd.img". 

That's all that is needed, just launch the script and boot the core.

In the SW folder there is also a file called "boot.rom" which contains Sergey Kiselev's open source 8088 BIOS, along with the XTIDE UniversalBIOS ready to boot from the serial port. However, Sergey Kiselev's BIOS has some problems with the keyboard and is a bit slow... while this issue is being solved, you can run the python script "make_boot_with_jukost.py" from inside the SW folder, which will generate a boot.rom file with the Juko ST BIOS in place, much more stable and with good performance.

# ChangeLog

### Beta 1.0

* The UART port is changed to the internal MiSTer port, now it is possible to use the core without using a USB cable

### Beta 0.10

* Increased RAM mapping in SDRAM: 0x00000-0xAFFFF and 0xC0000-0xEFFFF

Segments 0xB0000 (VRAM) and 0xF0000 (BIOS) are still assigned to BRAM

### Beta 0.9

* Add SDRAM module, by @kitune-san

### Beta 0.8

* MDA and CGA/Tandy now work at the same time. It is possible to switch from one to the other from the OSD menu, as well as their monochrome simulation independently.
* Fixed problem with INT0 test failing
* Fixed a bug that caused the timer counter to be cleared on latch.
* PCXT DIP switches and access to MDA memory
* Add port_b[6] to lock PS/2 CLK.
* PS/2 CLK to drop LOW after receiving the key code.

### Beta 0.7

* 4.77Mhz CPU clock with 33% duty cycle, thanks to @MicroCoreLabs
* Peripheral clock now works at half cpu clock, for correct synchronisation with the 8253 timer, thanks to @kitune-san
* Turbo option is disabled for the moment, requires a redesign of the BIU... for the to-do list

### Beta 0.6

* UART module implementation fix, thanks to @kitune-san

### Beta 0.5

* Added UART module from ao486 project (COM1 assigned to USER I/O pins)
* Automatic loading of the BIOS ROM from /games/PCXT directory
* BIOS ROM hot swapping from the OSD menu
* Updated the code to the latest version of the SDRAM module of KFPC-XT, but not yet implemented in the core... needs to be revised and improved, it does not work properly

### Beta 0.4

* Added Adlib FM (JTOPL2)
* Added SN76489AN (PCjr Sound)
* Change to alternative BIOS from PCXT version 0.9.8 developed by Sergey Kiselev, with OPL FM sound card detector

### Beta 0.3

* Change to KFPC-XT. The use of MCL86 and Graphics Gremlin are maintained.
* Use of Sergey Kiselev's (@skiselev) XT 8088 BIOS project.
* Turbo mode enabled, 4.77Mhz or 7.16Mhz selectable from OSD.

### Beta 0.2

* PIC module downgraded to the first versions of the Next186 project, more basic and without ISR
* Possibility to activate and deactivate IRQ0 from the OSD menu, temporary feature.

### Beta 0.1

* Monochrome monitor simulation option (green, amber, B&W)

Unstable version:

* Hardware interrupts are not executed.
* No VHD or SD support.
* BASIC ROM execution set in the BIOS, before the OS load routine.
